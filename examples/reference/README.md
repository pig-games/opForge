# Reference Output

These are known-good outputs from assembling files in the examples directory. When the assembler is modified, the examples should be assembled and their list and hex files compared to these files.

If differences are found due to a bug fix or syntax change, new versions of these reference files should be generated and checked in.

Note that a change in the assembler version will cause a difference in the first line of the list file. There is no need to check in a new version of the reference files if this is the only difference.
