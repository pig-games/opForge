//! CPU family abstraction for hierarchical parsing and encoding.
//!
//! This module defines the traits for family-level and CPU-level handlers
//! that implement the hierarchical processing model described in the architecture.
//!
//! # Architecture Overview
//!
//! ```text
//! Generic Parser → Family Handler → CPU Handler → Output
//! ```
//!
//! - **Generic Parser**: Handles labels, directives, macros, scopes, expressions
//! - **Family Handler**: Parses operands into family addressing modes, encodes common instructions
//! - **CPU Handler**: Resolves ambiguous operands, encodes CPU-specific instructions
